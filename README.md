# Bird-Audio-Classification

## Background
Birds play an important role in many key ecosystem functions, and they provide economic value due to the increasing interest in birdwatching worldwide. Birds are a uniquely diverse class of organisms, existing on every continent around the world and adapted to nearly every type of environment. Major conservation efforts relating to avian species rely on the surveillance of population abundance, diversity, and migration timing and pathways. Many bird species have been identified as useful biodiversity indicators because they are sensitive to environmental and climatic changes.

Bird sounds provide a variety of information that can help us better understand bird population dynamics, breeding habits and evolutionary changes. However, with around 10,000 identified bird species worldwide, and many whose vocalizations are quite similar, it is difficult for casual birders and research professionals to accurately identify all birds by sound. Additionally, for people with the expertise to identify birds by sound, it can be challenging and time consuming to accurately record and annotate all bird audios in the field. Because of the high degree of human involvement currently required in the sound identification process, many areas around the world, particularly remote areas and areas with high bird diversity, lack data completeness. Lastly, birders can become frustrated and confused by the difficulty of identifying birds by their vocalizations, leading to a less enjoyable birdwatching experience.

With the sound recognition and associated data management capabilities available today, it is feasible to develop a program that autonomously identifies and tracks bird vocalizations with minimum human intervention. Said program could be a useful tool for understanding ecosystem health, tracking conservation efforts, and evaluating species richness by improving data reliability and comprehensiveness while minimizing active human involvement. For the public, it can serve as a learning tool for less experienced birders and make early experiences more enjoyable and rewarding.

## About the Project
I aimed to create an automated audio classification system for bird species. The automation of audio identification is more impactful than the automation of imagery for two main reasons. First, the acquisition of quality imagery requires light, high levels of human investment, and opportunities to see the bird plainly in a narrow scope of field. Meanwhile, audio recordings can be acquired anywhere within the detection radius of the recording instrument with no impact from the time of day or the conspicuousness of the bird. Secondly, the expertise of birders and research professionals tend to favor visual identification skills, so having an automated sound identification system would typically better compliment and support the observerâ€™s skillset.

Since the number of avian species worldwide and the time it takes to train large sets of data is so high (>10,000), the dataset focuses on a subset of 264 species that can be found regularly in the United States each year.
