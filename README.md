# Bird-Audio-Classification

Birds play an important role in many key ecosystem functions, and they provide economic value
due to the increasing interest in birdwatching worldwide. Birds are a uniquely diverse class of
organisms, existing on every continent around the world and adapted to nearly every type of
environment. Major conservation efforts relating to avian species rely on the surveillance of
population abundance, diversity, and migration timing and pathways. Many bird species have
been identified as useful biodiversity indicators because they are sensitive to environmental and
climatic changes.
Bird sounds provide a variety of information that can help us better understand bird population
dynamics, breeding habits and evolutionary changes. However, with around 10,000 identified
bird species worldwide, and many whose vocalizations are quite similar, it is difficult for casual
birders and research professionals to accurately identify all birds by sound. Additionally, for
people with the expertise to identify birds by sound, it can be challenging and time consuming to
accurately record and annotate all bird audios in the field. Because of the high degree of human
involvement currently required in the sound identification process, many areas around the world,
particularly remote areas and areas with high bird diversity, lack data completeness. Lastly,
birders can become frustrated and confused by the difficulty of identifying birds by their
vocalizations, leading to a less enjoyable birdwatching experience.
With the sound recognition and associated data management capabilities available today, it is
feasible to develop a program that autonomously identifies and tracks bird vocalizations with
minimum human intervention. Said program could be a useful tool for understanding ecosystem
health, tracking conservation efforts, and evaluating species richness by improving data
reliability and comprehensiveness while minimizing active human involvement. For the public, it
can serve as a learning tool for less experienced birders and make early experiences more
enjoyable and rewarding.
